Request for GitHub Repository: Employee Management Application
Project Overview: I am requesting the creation of a GitHub repository for a web application that will interface with a Microsoft Access database. The application should include functionality for adding and searching employee records. The solution should be developed in JavaScript and be deployable online.

Requirements:

Database Schema:

Database Type: Microsoft Access
Table Name: Employees
Fields:
FirstName (Text)
LastName (Text)
DateOfEmployment (Date)
DateOfTermination (Date)
SupervisorFirstName (Text)
SupervisorLastName (Text)
Department (Text)
Photo (URL or File Path)
Features:

Employee Entry Form:
A form for adding new employee records into the database.
Should include fields matching the database schema.
Employee Search Form:
A form for searching employee records by last name.
User Authentication:
Basic authentication to allow different access levels:
Users who can add new records.
Users who can only search records.
Technology Stack:

Frontend: JavaScript (along with HTML and CSS for the user interface)
Backend: JavaScript-based server (e.g., Node.js with Express) to handle form submissions and interact with the Microsoft Access database.
Development Notes:

Backend Code:
Create API endpoints for adding and retrieving employee data.
Include data validation and error handling.
Frontend Code:
Develop user interfaces for the data entry and search forms.
Database Integration:
Provide example code for connecting to and interacting with the Microsoft Access database.
Deployment:

The application should be deployable online.
Include setup instructions and deployment guidelines in the repository.
Additional Requirements:

Documentation should be provided within the repository, including a README file with setup and usage instructions.
Include comments within the code for clarity and future modifications.
Request:

Create a GitHub repository that meets the above specifications.
Provide an initial setup or template to facilitate development.
Thank you for your assistance with this project!
